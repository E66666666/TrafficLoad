This is an attempt to fix the taxi bug in GTA IV. It works by forcing loading and unloading vehicle models. In addition to fixing the taxi bug, this mod allows more diverse traffic to occur, including vehicles which normally do not spawn in normal traffic, like the Bus and Infernus. By using TrafficLoad.ini, settings can be changed and additional vehicles can be added to the loading cycle.

To make any changes to this project, simply [clone it](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/E66666666/TrafficLoad) or [download](https://github.com/E66666666/TrafficLoad/archive/master.zip) this project. It has all necessary files to build. Grab TrafficLoad.dll from /Debug or /Release, depending on your build settings and put it in the GTA IV root folder along with your .asi loaders. eModel.txt contails all road-vehicle eModels.
